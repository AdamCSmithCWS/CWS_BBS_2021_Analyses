# CWS 2021 data-version Trend Analysis

Canadian Wildlife Service, BBS status and trend analyses for 2021 data version.

This analysis was done using bbsBayes (<https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/bbsBayes>), and some additional functions and code to fit the models in Stan, instead of JAGS.

This repo includes some git commits that tracked initial work to support the new version of bbsBayes - the package bbsBayes2 (<https://github.com/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2>).

Scripts that are numbered 1, 1a, 2, 3, 4, and 5, include the full workflow from raw BBS data to the trend estimates, trend-maps, population trajectories, and rolling short-term trends necessary to recreate the 2021 CWS trend analyses.
